### 1. Research Questions and Hypotheses:
- **Assessment**: The research questions aimed at understanding attitudes toward open science practices are implied but not explicitly stated in the survey questions provided. The questions focus on data sharing, study pre-registration, and familiarity with reproducibility practices, which are components of open science but do not encompass all its aspects.
- **Concrete Example**: Question 1 asks about the importance of data sharing but does not explore other open science practices like open access publishing or open methodology.
- **Recommendations**: Explicitly state the research questions at the beginning of the survey. Expand the survey to include questions about other dimensions of open science to fully address the research purpose.
- **Severity Rating**: Medium

### 2. Sampling Strategy:
- **Assessment**: The sampling method is not specified in the provided material. Without this information, it's challenging to evaluate the representativeness of the sample and potential sampling errors.
- **Concrete Example**: No details on whether participants were selected randomly, through convenience sampling, or other methods.
- **Recommendations**: Specify and justify the sampling method used. If a random sampling method is feasible, it would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Provide details on the sampling frame.
- **Severity Rating**: High

### 3. Survey Instrument Validity and Reliability:
- **Assessment**: The survey questions are straightforward but lack depth in exploring the constructs of open science fully. There is no information on pre-testing or piloting the survey to assess validity and reliability.
- **Concrete Example**: The use of a 1-5 scale is common, but without knowing the anchors of this scale (e.g., 1 = Not important at all, 5 = Extremely important), interpretation can vary.
- **Recommendations**: Conduct cognitive interviews or pilot testing to refine questions and ensure they accurately measure intended constructs. Define scale anchors clearly in the survey. Consider calculating reliability coefficients after data collection.
- **Severity Rating**: Medium

### 4. Data Collection Procedures:
- **Assessment**: There is no information on how data were collected (e.g., online, paper-based), the duration of data collection, or the response rate.
- **Concrete Example**: Missing details on the mode of survey administration and the total number of people surveyed versus the number who responded.
- **Recommendations**: Provide details on the data collection method, including the platform used (if online), the time frame for data collection, and efforts to maximize response rates (e.g., reminders, incentives).
- **Severity Rating**: Medium

### 5. Data Analysis Methods:
- **Assessment**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and group comparisons are appropriate for the data provided. However, the assumptions for correlation (e.g., linearity, normality) and group comparison tests (e.g., ANOVA assumptions) are not discussed.
- **Concrete Example**: High correlations are reported (e.g., 0.89 between impact factor importance and editorial reputation), but there is no mention of checking for multicollinearity or other potential issues.
- **Recommendations**: Verify assumptions for each statistical test used. Consider regression analysis to control for potential confounders in examining relationships between variables. Report effect sizes along with significance levels to provide a clearer interpretation of the findings.
- **Severity Rating**: Medium

### 6. Ethical Considerations:
- **Assessment**: There is no mention of ethical considerations such as informed consent, confidentiality of the data, or ethical approval from a review board.
- **Concrete Example**: Absence of information on how participant consent was obtained and how data privacy is ensured.
- **Recommendations**: Ensure that all participants provide informed consent, which details the purpose of the research, how the data will be used, and measures taken to protect privacy. Obtain ethical approval if not already done.
- **Severity Rating**: High

This review highlights several areas where the survey design and methodology could be improved to enhance the robustness and ethical integrity of the research. Specific recommendations have been provided to address each identified issue.
