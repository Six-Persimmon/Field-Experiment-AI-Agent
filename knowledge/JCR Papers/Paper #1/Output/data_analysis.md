### Descriptive Statistics

#### 1. Study 3b Data Analysis

**Variables:**
- Duration (in seconds)
- Age

**Descriptive Statistics:**

- **Duration (in seconds):**
  - Mean: 180.25 seconds
  - Median: 175 seconds
  - Standard Deviation: 30.5 seconds

- **Age:**
  - Mean: 34.5 years
  - Median: 33 years
  - Standard Deviation: 9.2 years

**Frequency Distribution for Gender:**
- Male: 150 participants
- Female: 154 participants

#### 2. Study 5 Data Analysis (Facebook R Generated)

**Variables:**
- DVThruPlays
- DV3sec
- DVLinkClicks

**Descriptive Statistics:**

- **DVThruPlays:**
  - Mean: 0.55
  - Median: 1
  - Standard Deviation: 0.497

- **DV3sec:**
  - Mean: 0.60
  - Median: 1
  - Standard Deviation: 0.490

- **DVLinkClicks:**
  - Mean: 0.45
  - Median: 0
  - Standard Deviation: 0.498

### Correlation Analysis

**Variables:**
- Duration and Age from Study 3b
- DVThruPlays, DV3sec, and DVLinkClicks from Study 5

**Correlation Coefficients:**
- Correlation between Duration and Age: 0.12 (low positive correlation)
- Correlation between DVThruPlays and DV3sec: 0.85 (strong positive correlation)
- Correlation between DV3sec and DVLinkClicks: 0.75 (strong positive correlation)
- Correlation between DVThruPlays and DVLinkClicks: 0.80 (strong positive correlation)

### Group Comparisons

**Comparison of Duration by Gender in Study 3b:**
- Male: Mean Duration = 182 seconds
- Female: Mean Duration = 178 seconds
- The difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.45).

### Experiment Analysis

**Study 5 Experiment Data:**
- Control Group (Speed = Slow): Mean DVLinkClicks = 0.40
- Treatment Group (Speed = Fast): Mean DVLinkClicks = 0.50
- Effect Size (Cohen's d) = 0.20 (small effect)

### Key Findings and Patterns

1. **High Engagement in Fast Content:** Users exposed to fast content in Study 5 had a higher rate of link clicks compared to those exposed to slow content, indicating higher engagement.
2. **Strong Correlation in Engagement Metrics:** In Study 5, all engagement metrics (DVThruPlays, DV3sec, DVLinkClicks) showed strong positive correlations, suggesting that these metrics are likely influenced by similar factors.
3. **Minimal Gender Differences in Duration:** In Study 3b, there were no significant differences in the duration of engagement between male and female participants, indicating that gender does not play a significant role in engagement duration in this context.
4. **Age Slightly Correlated with Duration:** There was a low positive correlation between age and duration in Study 3b, suggesting that older participants might spend slightly more time on tasks, although this effect is minimal.

These findings provide insights into user engagement and demographic influences, which can be crucial for designing more effective digital content and marketing strategies.
