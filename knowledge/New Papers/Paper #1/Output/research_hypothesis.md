# Research Hypothesis for Paper #1

we propose that the perception of bias for human as
compared to algorithmic decisions is driven by the fundamental
belief that algorithms, unlike humans, decontextualize decision-
making because they are unable to recognize the unique character-
istics of the individual being judged. We further argue that this fundamental belief can foster
two different inferences, depending on whether the situation entails
the potential for discrimination or not.algorithms
ignore the unique characteristics of the individual might lead
people to infer that algorithms are more likely than humans to
miss information that can be relevant to the judgment at hand, and
doing so might lead to systematic errors. In contrast, in the presence of
potential for discrimination (e.g., a black defendant), the belief
that algorithms ignore the unique characteristics of the individual
might lead people to infer that algorithms are more likely than
humans to treat everyone equally because they are more likely than
humans to neglect information that might be grounds for discrimi-
nation, and doing so avoids systematic errors. As a consequence,
algorithmic decisions should be perceived less biased than human
decisions. algorithmic decisions that yield disparities are less
likely than human decisions to be perceived as biased leads to three
predictions about potential consequences of key societal relevance. Studies 1aâ€“c show that decisions that yield racial and
gender disparities are less likely to be perceived as biased when they
stem from algorithms rather than humans. differences in perception of bias for human
versus algorithmic decisions are driven by the belief that algorithms,
unlike humans, decontextualize decision-making because they are
judged and blindly apply predetermined rules and procedures in a
unable to recognize the unique characteristics of the individual being
rigid way, irrespective of whom they are judging
