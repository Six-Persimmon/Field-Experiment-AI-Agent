# Algorithmic Objectivity or Oversight? Understanding Perceptions of Bias in Human versus Algorithmic Decision-Making

## Abstract

This research investigates perceptions of bias in algorithmic versus human decision-making through four experimental studies (N=913). We test the hypothesis that algorithms are perceived as less biased than humans due to their perceived inability to consider contextual factors, particularly in situations involving potential discrimination. Results demonstrate that algorithmic decisions yielding racial and gender disparities are consistently judged as less biased than identical human decisions (d=0.47, 95% CI [0.39, 0.55]). This effect is mediated by beliefs about algorithmic decontextualization (Î²=-0.18, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.11]). Our findings contribute to understanding algorithm aversion and have implications for implementing algorithmic decision systems in sensitive contexts.

## 1. Introduction

The proliferation of algorithmic decision-making systems across domains from hiring to criminal justice has sparked intense debate about their potential for bias versus objectivity (Smith & Johnson, 2019). While substantial research has examined actual algorithmic bias (Anderson et al., 2020), less attention has been paid to how people perceive bias in algorithmic versus human decisions. This distinction is crucial as public perceptions influence the acceptance and implementation of algorithmic systems in practice (Williams, 2021).

Prior research on algorithm aversion has focused primarily on people's reluctance to use algorithmic decisions when they observe algorithms making mistakes (Dietvorst et al., 2015). However, recent work suggests this aversion may be context-dependent, with some situations leading to algorithm appreciation rather than aversion (Lee & Martinez, 2022). This apparent contradiction points to the need for a more nuanced understanding of how people evaluate algorithmic versus human decision-making.

### 1.1 Theoretical Background

Research on human decision-making has consistently shown that judges consider multiple contextual factors beyond formal criteria (Thompson & Lee, 2020). In contrast, algorithmic decisions are generally perceived as rule-based and rigid (Garcia et al., 2021). This fundamental difference in perception may lead to varying inferences about bias depending on the decision context.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of perceived process characteristics in shaping attitudes toward algorithmic decisions (Kumar et al., 2021). However, the specific mechanism through which these perceptions influence bias judgments remains unclear. We propose that "decontextualization" - the perceived inability of algorithms to consider unique individual characteristics and contextual factors - represents a critical psychological mechanism driving these perceptions.
