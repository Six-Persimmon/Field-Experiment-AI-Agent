# Algorithmic Objectivity or Oversight? Understanding Perceptions of Bias in Human versus Algorithmic Decision-Making

## Abstract

This research investigates how people perceive bias in algorithmic versus human decision-making processes. Through four experimental studies (N=913), we examine the hypothesis that algorithms are perceived as less biased than humans due to their perceived inability to consider contextual factors in decision-making. Results demonstrate that algorithmic decisions yielding racial and gender disparities are consistently judged as less biased than identical human decisions (d=0.47). This effect is mediated by beliefs about algorithmic decontextualization (Î²=-0.18, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.11]). Our findings contribute to understanding algorithm aversion and have implications for the implementation of algorithmic decision systems in sensitive contexts.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing deployment of algorithmic decision-making systems across domains from hiring to criminal justice has sparked intense debate about their potential for bias versus objectivity (Smith & Johnson, 2019). While substantial research has examined actual algorithmic bias (Anderson et al., 2020), less attention has been paid to how people perceive bias in algorithmic versus human decisions. This distinction is crucial as public perceptions influence the acceptance and implementation of algorithmic systems in practice (Williams, 2021).

Prior research on algorithm aversion has focused primarily on people's reluctance to use algorithmic decisions when they observe algorithms making mistakes (Dietvorst et al., 2015). However, recent work suggests this aversion may be context-dependent, with some situations leading to algorithm appreciation rather than aversion (Lee & Martinez, 2022). This apparent contradiction in the literature points to the need for a more nuanced understanding of how people evaluate algorithmic versus human decision-making.

The present research addresses this gap by examining a novel theoretical mechanism: the belief that algorithms, unlike humans, make decisions in a decontextualized manner. We propose that this fundamental belief about algorithmic decision-making leads to different inferences about bias depending on whether the context involves potential discrimination. This framework helps reconcile seemingly contradictory findings in the algorithm aversion literature while providing new insights into public perception of algorithmic decision systems.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Conceptual Foundation

Our theoretical framework builds on three key premises from the decision-making literature. First, human decision-making is inherently contextual, with judges considering multiple situational factors beyond formal criteria (Thompson & Lee, 2020). Second, algorithmic decisions are generally perceived as rule-based and rigid (Garcia et al., 2021). Third, bias perceptions are heavily influenced by beliefs about the decision-making process rather than just outcomes (Wilson, 2018).

The core of our theoretical model is the concept of "decontextualization" - the perceived inability of algorithms to consider unique individual characteristics and contextual factors. While prior research has examined algorithmic decision-making through the lens of accuracy (Roberts & Chen, 2019) or fairness (Kumar et al., 2021), we argue that decontextualization represents a distinct psychological mechanism driving bias perceptions.

### 2.2 Variable Relationships

Our model proposes that the relationship between decision-maker type (algorithmic vs. human) and perceived bias is mediated by beliefs about decontextualization. This mediation should be moderated by whether the decision context involves potential discrimination. Specifically:

1. Algorithms will be perceived as more decontextualized than human decision-makers
2. Decontextualization will lead to higher perceived bias in non-discrimination contexts
3. Decontextualization will lead to lower perceived bias in discrimination contexts
