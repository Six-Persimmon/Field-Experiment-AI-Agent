# Research Paper Outline

## 1. Title
"Algorithmic Objectivity or Oversight? Understanding Perceptions of Bias in Human versus Algorithmic Decision-Making"

## 2. Abstract
- Problem statement: Investigating perceived bias in algorithmic vs. human decision-making
- Methodology: Series of 4 studies (n=913 total participants)
- Key findings: Algorithms perceived as less biased due to decontextualization beliefs
- Implications: Impact on acceptance of algorithmic decision systems
- Contribution: Novel theoretical framework for understanding algorithm aversion
