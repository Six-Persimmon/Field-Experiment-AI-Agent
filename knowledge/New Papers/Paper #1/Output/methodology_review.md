I'll provide a detailed methodological review based on the available information, though note that some aspects of the survey design appear to be missing from the provided materials.

1. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES

Strengths:
- Hypothesis clearly articulates the proposed mechanism (decontextualization)
- Multiple testable predictions are specified
- Clear directional predictions about algorithmic vs human bias perceptions

Issues:
a) Operational Definition Ambiguity (Severity: High)
- "Decontextualization" lacks precise operational definition
- Recommendation: Define specific measurable indicators of decontextualization
- Example: "Decontextualization will be measured through X specific behaviors/judgments..."

b) Confounding Variables Not Addressed (Severity: Medium)
- Hypothesis doesn't account for prior experience with algorithms
- Recommendation: Add explicit sub-hypotheses about moderating variables

2. SAMPLING STRATEGY

Based on the data provided:
n = 160 (Study 1a)
n = 168 (Study 1b)
n = 170 (Study 1c)

Issues:
a) Sample Size Adequacy (Severity: Medium)
- For mediation analysis in Study 4, sample size appears insufficient
- Power analysis for mediation (Î±=.05, power=.80) suggests minimum n=400 needed
- Recommendation: Increase sample size for mediation study

b) Demographic Skew (Severity: Medium)
- 58.2% female sample indicates potential gender bias
- Recommendation: Implement stratified random sampling to balance demographics

3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

Strengths:
- Multiple studies testing different aspects of hypothesis
- Inclusion of control conditions

Critical Issues:
a) Manipulation Check Missing (Severity: High)
- No verification that participants perceived algorithmic vs human difference
- Recommendation: Add manipulation check questions

b) Between vs Within Design (Severity: Medium)
- Current between-subjects design increases variance
- Recommendation: Consider mixed design with some within-subject comparisons

4. SURVEY INSTRUMENT VALIDITY

Cannot fully assess without seeing actual survey items, but from results:

a) Construct Validity Concerns (Severity: High)
- Single bias rating measure (1-7 scale) may be insufficient
- Recommendation: Develop multi-item bias perception scale
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for multi-item measures

5. DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES

Issues identified from analysis:
a) Temporal Effects (Severity: Low)
- No indication of data collection timeframe
- Recommendation: Report collection period and test for temporal effects

6. DATA ANALYSIS METHODS

Strengths:
- Appropriate use of t-tests for group comparisons
- Mediation analysis employed for mechanism testing

Issues:
a) Statistical Assumption Testing (Severity: Medium)
- No reporting of normality tests
- Recommendation: Report assumption tests for all analyses

b) Effect Size Reporting (Severity: Low)
- Inconsistent reporting across studies
- Recommendation: Standardize effect size reporting (Cohen's d) across all studies

7. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Cannot fully assess without more procedural details, but:

a) Deception Concerns (Severity: Medium)
- Potential deception about algorithm vs human decision-makers
- Recommendation: Add detailed debriefing procedure

Specific Recommendations for Improvement:

1. Statistical:
- Add confirmatory factor analysis for construct validation
- Include bootstrap confidence intervals for mediation
- Report effect sizes consistently across all studies

2. Design:
- Add manipulation checks
- Implement balanced sampling strategy
- Include attention check items

3. Measurement:
- Develop multi-item scales for key constructs
- Add behavioral measures beyond self-report
- Include social desirability controls

4. Analysis:
- Conduct sensitivity analyses
- Test for demographic moderators
- Add robustness checks with alternative specifications

The most critical issues requiring immediate attention are:
1. Lack of manipulation checks
2. Single-item dependent measure
3. Sample size for mediation analysis
4. Missing operational definitions

These should be addressed before proceeding with additional data collection.
