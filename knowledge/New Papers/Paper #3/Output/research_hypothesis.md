# Research Hypothesis for Paper #3

H1. The prospect to access an explanation
of how an algorithm works leads to a feeling
of empowerment that results in an illusion
of understanding how the algorithm works,
compared to not having the prospect to ac-
cess an explanation.
H2. The prospect to access an explanation of
how an algorithm works leads to a greater illu-
sion of understanding when the explanation is
written for the general public than for experts.                                                    
H3. The prospect to access an explanation
of how an algorithm works leads to a smaller
illusion of understanding when the explana-
tion is not instrumental to interacting more
effectively with an algorithm.
