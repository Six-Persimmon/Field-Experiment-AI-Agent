### 5. Key Findings and Patterns

1. **Significant Empowerment Correlation:** There is a strong correlation between understanding and empowerment metrics across experiments, supporting the hypothesis that access to explanations enhances perceived empowerment.
2. **Condition Impact:** The prospect of an explanation significantly enhances the illusion of understanding, particularly when explanations are provided post-experiment (Experiment_7).
3. **Effect Sizes:** Moderate effect sizes in the key comparisons suggest that while the effects are present, they are not overwhelmingly strong.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis supports Hypotheses 1 and 2, indicating that the prospect of accessing an explanation enhances the illusion of understanding and empowerment. The data from Experiment_6 and Experiment_7 particularly support these findings. However, more detailed analysis would be required for Hypothesis 3, focusing on the instrumentality of the explanations.
