### 5. Key Findings and Patterns

1. **High Correlation Between Empowerment and Understanding**: In both experiments, there is a strong correlation between participants' feelings of empowerment and their understanding scores.
2. **Significant Differences Between Conditions**: ANOVA results indicate significant differences in understanding and empowerment based on the experimental condition, supporting the hypothesis that access to explanations affects perceived understanding.
3. **Effect Sizes Indicate Moderate Impact**: The effect sizes suggest a moderate impact of the experimental conditions on understanding, particularly when explanations are tailored (Experiment_7).

**Evaluation of Hypotheses**:
- **H1**: Supported. Access to explanations increases the illusion of understanding.
- **H2**: Supported. Explanations for the general public lead to higher understanding scores than those for experts.
- **H3**: Partially supported. Lower instrumentality explanations do not significantly reduce understanding scores but show a trend.

**Unexpected Findings**:
- The strong correlation between empowerment dimensions suggests that these scales may be measuring similar constructs, which could be investigated further for scale refinement.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the data, supporting most of the research hypotheses and offering insights into how explanations impact user perception and empowerment.
