    "3": "The open-ended question invites detailed feedback and assumes various improvement areas, promoting comprehensive responses and avoiding leading language.",
    "4": "The likelihood to recommend question also uses a five-point Likert scale. This metric, often referred to as Net Promoter Score (NPS), effectively gauges customer loyalty and satisfaction.",
    "5": "An additional comments section is provided to enable respondents to share anything else on their minds, ensuring that all feedback avenues are open."
